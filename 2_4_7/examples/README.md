Example CCDs for MLHIM Reference Implementation 2.4.7
=====================================================

This directory contains three example CCDs and XML instance files generated by the CCD-Gen.

They are not meant for any use other than to demonstrate usage of all of the RM complexTypes.
The models are completely nonsensical. 

The examples use UUIDs generated by a development version of the CCD-Gen and will not match those from the live version.
