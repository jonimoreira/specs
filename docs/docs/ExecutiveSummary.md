**Executive Summary**

_Keep
everything as simple as possible; but no simpler. - Albert Einstein_

MLHIM (pronounced _muh-leem_)
is an 

agile and open

framework for computable semantic
interoperability in healthcare. This capability is required in order
to advance the usage of clinical (and other) decision support
services (CDSS) and Big Data analysis across data coming from
multiple points.  These points of data creation are increasing every
day as a result of more institutions bringing new digital
capabilities to more functions, in addition to the plethora of new
devices arriving in the personal healthcare marketplace. 

MLHIM is not a _standard_ in the historical sense of the
term.  The standards development process is far from agile;
healthcare is too dynamic to wait for the 20

th century
standards processes. In addition, healthcare is too broad for a
top-down, one-size-fits-all solution for information
interoperability. MLHIM is based on widely used standards for data
exchange and expression on the semantic web. 

MLHIM can be implemented as the information model for applications
ranging from mobile apps to enterprise suites. MLHIM is also useful
to enhance semantic interoperability of existing systems and
healthcare IT interfaces such as those based on HL7 messaging.

MLHIM specifically addresses the need to communicate syntactically
sound data with the intended semantics. The larger picture of
information exchange is already handled by other formal  and de-facto
standards.
