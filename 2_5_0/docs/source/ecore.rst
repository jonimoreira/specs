=============
Eclipse Ecore
=============

There is now an Eclipse Ecore model included in the documentation.
If people find it useful please expand on it. I have very little experience with Eclipse.

I could really use some help making this more useful.  Maybe you can even generate a Java code base from it?   Maybe you can edit CCD models in it?  Maybe you can generate Python code?  I have no idea ...

The things missing are:

1. DvInterval upper and lower are not typed checked because the Eclipse XML Tools can't handle asserts.
2. The extra durations from XML Schema 1.1 are not present in DvTemporal for the same reason.

Everything should be there.

If you can help with using this Ecore model to 'do something' please let me know.
