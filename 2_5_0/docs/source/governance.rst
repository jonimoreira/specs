Governance
==========

The MLHIM project was originally started by four individuals with a desire to build an openly available approach to true syntactic interoperability as well as computable semantic interoperability for global healthcare IT.  

The founding agreement signed by these four guarantees that the MLHIM specifications documents and the reference implementation will be published under open content and open source licenses. 

The MLHIM project is a meritocracy.  Anyone may participate in the community which uses the`Google Plus <http://goo.gl/EoLGJM>`_ social network community for discussions. It is a private community only for the sake of SPAM reduction.  No requests to join will be denied.  However, SPAMMING the community with off-topic content will get you banned immediately, without notice.  
You can also find us (occasionally) on the IRC network, Freenode channel #mlhim.

The complete governance guidelines and Contributor License Agreement (CLA) can be found in the repository in the document MLHIM_governance_model.pdf. They are also available under the Documents section of the MLHIM web site.
