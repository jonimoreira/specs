*Keep everything as simple as possible; but no simpler. - Albert Einstein*

**MLHIM** is an agile and open framework for computable semantic interoperability in healthcare. This capability is required in order to advance the usage of clinical (and other) decision support services (CDSS) and Big Data analysis across data coming from multiple points.  These points of data creation are increasing every day as a result of more institutions bringing new digital capabilities to more functions, in addition to the plethora of new devices arriving in the personal healthcare marketplace. 

MLHIM is not a *standard* in the historical sense of the term. The standards development process is far from agile; healthcare is too dynamic to wait for the 20th century
standards processes. In addition, healthcare is too broad for a top-down, one-size-fits-all solution for information interoperability. MLHIM is based on widely used standards for data
exchange and expression on the semantic web. 

MLHIM uses these tools in conjunction with the Unix/Linux model of iterate and release often. A new release does not invalidate the previous models or data.

MLHIM can be implemented as the information model for applications ranging from mobile apps to enterprise suites. MLHIM is also useful to enhance semantic interoperability of existing systems and healthcare IT interfaces such as those based on HL7 messaging.

MLHIM specifically addresses the need to communicate syntactically sound data with the intended semantics. The larger picture of information exchange is already handled by other formal and de-facto standards and MLHIM builds on those standards.

We have a growing amount of *peer-reviewed* material on our `website <http://mlhim.org/documents.html>`_ as well as invited presentations and educational material on `SlideShare <http://www.slideshare.net/twcook>`_ and `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/user/MLHIMdotORG>`_.  

MLHIM is the foundation for retro-fitting your current applications to interoperate with your future applications without requiring wholesale replacement.
