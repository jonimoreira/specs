#Changes from 2.4.6 to 2.4.7  (see the git commit msgs. for details)                     
    Added 'units' capability to DvInterval.
    Simplified DvCodedString.
    Fixed bug in ExceptionalValueRef in  ontology.
    Made a change to complexType definitions for rdf:about

#Changes from 2.4.5 to 2.4.6  (see the git commit msgs. for details)                     
    Established a single namespace for all artifacts. The prefix and namespace are:
    mlhim2='http://www.mlhim.org/xmlns/mlhim2'

    Changed the RDF Subject, 'rdf:about=' value, to a full URI  http://www.mlhim.org/xmlns/mlhim2/ct- with the UUID appended.
    
    Added an OWL ontology for RM 2.4.6 Visualize the ontology here: http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/index.html?#iri=http://www.mlhim.org/xmlns/mlhim2/mlhim246.owl

    Moved the ontology and RM physical locations to the namespace location on mlhim.org.

    Updated the CCD and instance examples. Added the XSLT to render the CCD in a browser.  Works with Firefox on local files but not in Chrome.
    Both browsers work when using the CCD-Gen. 

    
#Changes from 2.4.4 to 2.4.5  (see the git commit msgs. for details)                     
    Modified DvBooleanType to use valid-true or valid-false in a xs:choice and deleted DvBoolean-dv. 
    Modified DvIntervalType to improve validation of the upper and lower data type selections. 
    Added AuditType to simplify and improve the audit trail functionality.
    Removed FeederAuditType and FeederAuditDetailsType.
    Modified entry-audit to use the new AuditType. Set maxOccurs to unbounded so each step in processing gets a new audit element. 
    Modified DvRatio numerator and denominator minOccurs to 0 (zero) to support modeling of adimensional ratios without these    being explicit. Also modified their related units requirement to zero. Examples of this are odds ratios.
